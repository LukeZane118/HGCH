## HGCH: A Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Network Model for Heterogeneous Collaborative Graph Recommendation
This repository contains the implementation of HGCH based on RecBole, which is mainly in the `extra` folder. The current version is an old implementation. The final accepted version has some modifications, which are currently being organized and expected to be updated within a month.

## Environment:
The code was developed and tested on the [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) v1.0.1.
